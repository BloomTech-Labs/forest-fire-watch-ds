## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/LHd7GbuL/labs15-forest-fire)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/dd55f670427b40f7bc0503e36ad58ea9?v=d4cc255c2ad341a1b2ccd03f0d8d86f9)

### Problem
 - It's hard to be aware of wildfires in your area because all data is compiled for government use.
 - Local alerts for wildfires can fail in emergencies.
 - If you aren't generally aware of wildfire risk, you won't be ready in a disaster situation.
 
### Objectives
 
 - Provide an easy way to be aware of wildfires in your area.
 
[Deployed Front End](https://fireflight.netlify.com/)

### Tech Stack

SQL, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGB, HDBSCAN, Flask

### Classification Model

A model has been created using historic NASA satellite data, matched by date and location to known wildfires within the US. We are using this labled data in conjunction with NASA's current active fire data to correctly classify wildfires from live satellite image data. 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explanatory Variables

-   Brightness - Brightness temperature 21 (Kelvin) 
-   Scan - Along Scan pixel size 
-   Track - Along Scan pixel size
-   Acq_Date - Acquisition Date 
-   Acq_Time  - Acquisition Time 
-   Satellite -  	A = Aqua and T = Terra
-   Confidence - Confidence (0-100%) 
-   Bright_T31 - Brightness temperature 31 (Kelvin) 
-   FRP - Fire Radiative Power (MW - megawatts) 
-   DayNight  - Day or Night 
-   Clusters - Binary Y/N if pixel is part of a clutser
