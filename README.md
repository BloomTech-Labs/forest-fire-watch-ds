## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/LHd7GbuL/labs15-forest-fire)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/dd55f670427b40f7bc0503e36ad58ea9?v=d4cc255c2ad341a1b2ccd03f0d8d86f9)

### Problem
 - People aren't being properly alerted of potential danger.
 - There is not enough awareness of the long lasting effects of wildfires and the potential danger to my area.
 - People aren't prepared for evacuation when the time comes to do so.
 
 ### Objectives
 
 - Provide danger alerts to those in danger areas
 - Provide an increasingly accurate list of places that show what is most likely to be the next location of wildfires.**
 - Continuously add data sources to help better predict the movement of wild fires.**
 - Enable users to create quick and easy-to-access "Emergency Response" checklists that help them remember critical items and steps in the event of an evacuation

[Deployed Front End](https://fireflight.netlify.com/)

### Tech Stack

SQL, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask

### Predictions

A model has been created using historic NASA satellite data, matched by date and location to known wildfires within the US. We are using this labled data in conjunction with NASA's current active fire data to predict likely wildire locations.
